# How belief in ghosts and other extraneous opinions relate to political affiliation

A Support Vector Machine is used to attempt to predict people's political affiliation based on seemingly irrelevant questions from a Cards Against Humanity survey. The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/cardsagainsthumanity/pulse-of-the-nation. This was part of a machine learning project for Montana State University in Spring 2020. Cassie Noble and David Kelly collaborated on the code and presentation. 

The video presentation and pdf of the slides are available in the presentation folder. The code folder contains the MATLAB code used for the majority of the analysis and visualizations, as well as R code used to create an alluvial diagram.
